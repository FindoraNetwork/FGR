    \item restore the genesis data from tendermint when creating new \LSTINLINE{Ledger}
    \item add some special logics to check transactions related to the \LSTINLINE{PUB ACCOUNT}
    \item for each block, at most one transaction can do transfer from the \LSTINLINE{PUB ACCOUNT} to outside
    \item create a customed \LSTINLINE{txn_builder} static library for \LSTINLINE{golang ffi}
    \item add necessary codes in the \LSTINLINE{Tendermint} to support the logic mentioned above
\end{ENUMERATE}
