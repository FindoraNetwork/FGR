\subsection{Overview}

~\par

All \LSTINLINE{Block Rewards} finally come from FGA.

There can only be one transaction transferred from FGA in each block,
and the amount cannot exceed the officially defined block reward,
and its destination must be FFA.

\subsection{Jobs in Findora}

~\par

Ensure that the following rules are all effective:

\begin{itemize}
    \item FGA can only transfer funds to FFA
    \item FGA can only transfer outward once per block
    \item Each transfer amount of FGA must not be higher than the officially defined block reward
    \item A single bad validator cannot reach a consensus on the whole network
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Jobs in Tenderimint}

~\par

Recalling the \LSTINLINE{CreateProposalBlock()} function in Tendermint that we mentioned in \ref{tendermint:CreateProposalBlock},
we can go a step further and add a special rule to it, as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=go]
    /**
     * tendermint(v0.33.5)/state/execution.go#92
     */
    func (blockExec *BlockExecutor) CreateProposalBlock(
        height int64,
        state State, commit *types.Commit,
        proposerAddr []byte,
    ) (*types.Block, *types.PartSet) {
        maxBytes := state.ConsensusParams.Block.MaxBytes
        maxGas := state.ConsensusParams.Block.MaxGas

        maxNumEvidence, _ := types.MaxEvidencePerBlock(maxBytes)
        evidence := blockExec.evpool.PendingEvidence(maxNumEvidence)

        maxDataBytes := types.MaxDataBytes(maxBytes, state.Validators.Size(), len(evidence))
        txs := blockExec.mempool.ReapMaxBytesMaxGas(maxDataBytes, maxGas)

        // Right here!
        //
        // Below is the form of `AppendFeeTx()`' in the 'Transaction Fee' section:
        //
        // ```
        // txs = findora.AppendFeeTx(txs)
        // ```
        //
        // Now, suppose our block reward is 10 token, consider the following rules:
        //
        // - transfer 10 token from FGA to FFA
        // - transfer all transactions in FFA to validator
        // - the input address must be the address of `FFA`
        // - transfer from `FGA` and `FFA` is only allowed once in each block
        //     - prevent verifiers from doing bad things
        //     - ensure this in the ABCI's `DeliverTx()` based on our APP logic
        //
        // That's it!
        // The `transaction fee` and `block rewards` will be done at the same time.
        // Finally, we rename the original `AppendFeeTx()` to `AppendFeeAndRewards()`:
        //
        // ```
        // txs = findora.AppendFeeAndRewards(txs)
        // ```

        return state.MakeBlock(height, txs, commit, evidence, proposerAddr)
    }
\end{lstlisting}
