Our previous ideas were limited to those blackbox-like operations on the api provided by
\href{https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint}{Tendermint}, this brought many limitations to our action space.
The solutions described in this article no longer use the premise of completely basing on the tendermint API,
and will make changes to the tendermint itself.

Currently, only three parts are covered:

\begin{ITEMIZE}
    \item  transaction fee
    \item  genesis state
    \item  block reward
\end{ITEMIZE}
